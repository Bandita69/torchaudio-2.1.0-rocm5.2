# torchaudio-2.1.0-rocm5.2 

It works with the https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/manylinux/.private-9bd8754a636553e1d1ce3e107bf18c00/20231018/

Built with python 3.9.5 on Ubuntu 22.10 for XTTS v2 to work with my RX5700XT

Extra: when i used it with xtts, i noticed the first generation is very slow. But it speeds up eventualy.
